      <p>
        Press Press is an interdisciplinary publishing initiative that operates out of a storefront studio in Baltimore City and was founded in 2014. PP’s publishing practice is organized around two key goals; first, to shift and deepen the understanding of voices, identities, and narratives that have been suppressed or misrepresented by the mainstream, so far focusing on immigration and race in the United States; and second, to build networks of relationships through publishing practices centered on self-representation and gathering. Through an understanding of publishing as the act of gathering a public, PP’s streams of work include public cultural programming, an open-access publishing studio that’s based on an exchange economy, ongoing publishing workshops in an immigrant + refugee only space, and the ongoing production of print and digital publications.

        Collective Structure &amp; Organizers
      </h2>
      <p>
        Press Press is a fluid and reflexive network of co-authors and co-organizers. Depending on the project at hand, there may be anywhere from 1-45 people involved at a time and at various levels of capacity; from authoring publication chapters and library sections, speaking at an event, organizing a party, and more. Since we understand Press Press as a collectively-built and reflexive structure, we see all individuals and groups who steps into the project as crucial members of our team. However, there are some more consistent behind-the-scenes organizers we want to note by name…
